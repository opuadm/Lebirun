# Lebirun (C Version)
### Lebirun is a fun project i wanted to do to make a OS (that shouldn't be used in productions). This OS was formerly made with Cosmos in C#, now it's made in C and Assembly.
### I recommend running this OS in a hypervisor instead of your main machine, who knows what would happen
